        This is just a CMS project to demonstrate knowledge of PHP, MySQL, Laravel framework and JS.

        The developer's target wasn't to put a lot of effort on content but on functionality.
        <br><br>
        The admin can hire and fire moderators, delete any user and any post. S/he also can make 
        his/her own posts.

        <br><br>
